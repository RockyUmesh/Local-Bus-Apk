# Local-Bus-Apk
This apk was made just for learning purpose also there is no data for the users so users
might need to add the data.
If the USER downloads this apk then there are following conditions:
 1. User must posses device which uses OS Version 5 or above i.e. API>=21.
 2. User must have internet to use this apk.
 3. User must have at least 30MB free storage.
 4. User must have an e-mail id.

If the apk does not work then there might be this reasons:
 1. Either my Firebase account needs to extend the time limit or to needs to recheck it
 (as it was just a temporary project on the FIREBASE).
 2. User device might not meets the requirement.
